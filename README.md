This repository contains a GitHub actions used in StreamX repositories

## Create JIRA Release GitHub Action


This GitHub action is designed to automate the creation of JIRA releases. 
It operates by adding release version details to the `fix versions` field in a JIRA issues, 
driven by task numbers derived from commits since the previous git tag. 
The action should be set up to run subsequent to code checkouts in the earlier workflow steps.

### Inputs

This action requires the following inputs:

* `atlassianCloudUser`: Your Atlassian cloud user. This is required.
* `atlassianCloudApiKey`: Your Atlassian cloud ApiKey. This is required.
* `atlassianCloudDomain`: Your Atlassian cloud domain. This is required.
* `atlassianCloudJiraProject`: Your JIRA project. This is required.
* `releaseNamePrefix`: Your JIRA release name prefix. This is required.
* `tag`: This is an optional parameter. If provided, it will be used, otherwise, the latest git tag will be used.

### Usage

add following step to your GH workflow.

```yaml
      - name: Release Jira Version
        uses: streamx-dev/streamx-common-github-actions/.github/actions/jira-release@main
        with:
          atlassianCloudUser: ${{ secrets.ATLASSIAN_CLOUD_USER }}
          atlassianCloudApiKey: ${{ secrets.ATLASSIAN_CLOUD_APIKEY }}
          atlassianCloudDomain: ${{ secrets.ATLASSIAN_CLOUD_DOMAIN }}
          atlassianCloudJiraProject: ${{ vars.ATLASSIAN_CLOUD_JIRA_PROJECT }}
          releaseNamePrefix: ${{ github.event.repository.name }}
```

Secrets `ATLASSIAN_CLOUD_USER`, `ATLASSIAN_CLOUD_APIKEY`, and `ATLASSIAN_CLOUD_DOMAIN` are defined at the StreamX-dev organization level 
and should be accessible for all repositories without any additional configuration.

The `ATLASSIAN_CLOUD_JIRA_PROJECT` variable is also defined at the organizational level. 


## Create StreamX Connector GitHub Action

StreamX Connector GitHub is a Quarkus GitHub Action project that allows syncing GitHub
changes with StreamX.

Detail information please check [Quarkus GitHub Action](https://docs.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-github-action/dev/index.html) documentation.

### Actions
* publish - Publishes the selected ingestion data to StreamX.
* unpublish - Unpublishes the selected ingestion data from StreamX.
* sync - Dynamically selects and executes the appropriate ingestion action based on the source detection mechanism.

### Usage
```yaml
- uses: streamx-dev/streamx-common-github-actions/.github/actions/connector-github@v1
  with:
    # Name of the GitHub action (e.g., sync, publish, unpublish).
    # Value required.
    action:
      
    # Name of the StreamX ingestion channel. 
    # Important is that given value is supported by your StreamX instance. For validation check 
    # at GET ${streamx-ingestion-url}/ingestion/v1/channels
    #
    # Value required.
    channel:
      
    # StreamX ingestion api endpoint URL (e.g., https://ingestion.streamx.dev).
    #
    # Value required.
    streamx-ingestion-url:
      
    # StreamX ingestion API authorisation token.
    streamx-ingestion-token:
      
    # Specifies the provider name used to determine the ingestion data source.
    # Check section 'Ingestion data source provider' for details.
    #
    # Value required only with action sync, publish.
    source-provider:

    # Specifies the root directory for ingestion data lookup. Defaults to github.workspace.
    workspace:

    # Defines ingestion message key value property.
    #
    # Value required only with unpublish action.
    key:
      
    # Specifies the sx:type metadata field within the ingestion message properties.
    type:

    # Defines Ant-style path patterns for filtering ingestion data (e.g., styles/*.css, scripts/*.js).
    #
    # Value required only with a specific source provider. Check section 'Ingestion data source provider' for details.
    include-patterns:
      
    # URL property from where resource data is downloaded and used as ingestion data.
    #
    # Value required only with a specific source provider. Check section 'Ingestion data source provider' for details.
    external-resource-url:

    # When set to 'true', this configuration enables DEBUG-level logging during JBang execution.
    # Displays detailed output in the console, useful for troubleshooting and diagnostics.
    #
    # Default value 'false'.
    debug-enabled:    
```

#### Ingestion data source provider

* *BatchSourceProvider*

Source provider used for source lookup inside workspace directory and returns the list of all resources
that matches given `include-patterns` configuration.

```yaml
  with:
    source-provider: BatchSourceProvider
    # Value required for schema type detection for given channel configuration
    streamx-ingestion-url:
    # Value required for schema type detection 
    channel: 
    # Value required for limiting number of the resources
    include-patterns:
```

* *ExternalSourceProvider*

This data source provider allows to download data from external services.

```yaml
  with:
    source-provider: ExternalSourceProvider
    # Value required for schema type detection for given channel configuration
    streamx-ingestion-url:
    # Value required for schema type detection 
    channel:
    # URL property from where resource data is downloaded and used as ingestion data.
    external-resource-url:
    # Ingestion message key value property.
    key:
```

* *PullRequestDiffSourceProvider*

The source provider detects file changes, creations, and deletions associated with a given pull request GitHub event.

The step action must include a condition to ensure the event is a pull request and that the pull request has been merged
(e.g. `if:github.event.pull_request.merged == true`).
For accurate diff detection, all changelog data must be loaded during the checkout stage by setting the option:
`fetch-depth: 0`

```yaml
  with: 
    source-provider: PullRequestDiffSourceProvider
    # Value required for schema type detection for given channel configuration
    streamx-ingestion-url:
    # Value required for schema type detection 
    channel:
    # Value required for limiting number of the resources
    include-patterns:    
```
